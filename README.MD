# MEME Generator
###Modular Enterprisable MEAN Environment
This app is made to streamline the process of creating a MEAN app using the MEME organization system. I find that when I work on MEAN apps the majority of my time is spent building framework for the project. This generator is meant to remove all of that unneccessary work time and creates an incredibly modular MEAN app. MEME stands for Modular Enterprisable MEAN Environment.
###How to Install
```npm install -g yo
npm install -g meme-generator
npm install -g bower
npm install -g gulp
yo meme
yo meme:component
